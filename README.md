# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
I got the dataset from KPMG AU Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage.
The dataset contained 3 different file named as Customer Address, Customer Demographic, and Transaction.
First I assessed data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis through Excel, then use Python ( Jupyter Notebook) to extract some analytics and insights.
Analysed data to target high-value customers based on demographics and attributes.
